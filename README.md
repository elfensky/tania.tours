# tania.tours
A website of a Russian-speaking Belgian tour guide, made with primarily bootstrap and some minor javascript and php

It has been built using solely bootstrap for the layout, with minimal custom css for visuals such as background images.
This was done purely as a way to learn bootstrap as well as give myself design constraints.
